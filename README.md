An animation of the Solar System to *relative* scale

Two options:
1)  Sun is a smaller scale than everything else
    All other planets to scale (this means large Jupiter and Saturn)
    Distances between planets to relative scale

2)  Sun, Jupiter and Saturn (perhaps also Uranus & Neptune) is
    scaled smaller than the other planets

Alternative 2 is likely the best, since Jupiter is just extremely huge and it get's difficult to show Mercury and Jupiter to scale
Leave Mercury at diameter=2 and scale the rocky planets from there and then decide on scale of gas giants

Each planet travels in it's orbit at the "correct" speeds, even if that means Neptune takes forever to finish one revolution

Paths showing the orbits can be turned on/off and also option for dissappearing trail

Asteroid belt? Shown as a slowly rotating fog?

Users can enter a date to see the position of the planets in their orbits at that point in time

Add options to change model based on accuracy in
  - orbital speed
  - orbit shape(?)
  - relative size of planets (including sun?)
  - distance between planets

Orbits to scale are also just way to big... can barely see orbit of Mercury
